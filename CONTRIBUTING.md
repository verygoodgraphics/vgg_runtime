# Contributing Guidelines

First, thank you for using VGG! We welcome for issues, pull requests, or asking/answering questions on [Discard channel](#contact-us). Before that, please read [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Create an Issue
If you find any bug or have any idea, no matter a typo, a document error, or a runtime bug, feel free to create an issue.

If it's a simple bug easy to fix, you can create a [pull request](#pull-request) directly, bypassing this step.

1. Check [issue list](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime/issues) to avoid duplicated issues.
2. If it's security related, please report to [VGG](mailto:bd@verygoodgraphics.com) directly.
3. Follow the issue template, and fill in information as much as you can.

We will reply ASAP.

## Solve an Issue
If you want to solve an unassigned issue in [#help-wanted](https://github.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_runtime/labels/help%20wanted), you can reply under the comment thread, waiting for an assignment. You can create a [pull request](#pull-request) when the issue is sovled.

## Pull Request
If you can fix any bug or make any improvement, welcome to send a pull request (PR). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process. Checkout [GitHub's pull request tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) in case of any issue.

When opening a pull request, you will be asked to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](.github/CLA.md), by posting a comment under instructions.

### Basic PR Requirements
- Keep each commit atomic, and commit with clear messages.
- Follow the PR template, and write clear descriptions.
- For C++ code, we enforce the coding style via clang-format and clang-tidy.
- Make sure you put useful comments in your code.

Please refer to [Build Instructions](README.md#build-instructions) for how to build VGG runtime.
