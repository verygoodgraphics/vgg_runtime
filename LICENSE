      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical or manual
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      "Commercialization" shall mean any redistribution or any other
      commercial behavior of the Source, the Object, the Work or the
      Derivative Works that generate incomes or revenue.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. Exceptions
      may apply regarding charges and royalty fees, as specified in this
      License.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
      Source or Object form, where such license applies only to those patent
      claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
      their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Works or Derivative Works to which such Contribution(s) was
      submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
      (including across-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
      Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
      contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
      under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed. Exceptions may apply regarding charges and royalty
      fees, as specified in this License. Any generation of income or revenue
      based on the granting of a Patent License shall be deemed as
      Commercialization.

      The patent rights and patent application rights for the Source, Object,
      and Work belong to the Licensor. You are not allowed to apply for a
      patent using or based on the Source, Object, or Work.

   3. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License; and

      (e) You must pay the royalty while it applies according to this
          License; and

      (d) You may not remove or alter any license notices (including
          copyright notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
          liability) contained within any Work or Derivative Works.

   4. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   5. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   6. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   7. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   8. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   9. Royalty: Any Commercialization must subject to Royalty. The Product
      under Commercialization is referred to as "Royalty Products".

      (1) Before your Commercialization, you must give VGG of your intended
          Commercialization ("Notice of Commercialization") as early as
          reasonably possible and in any event prior to the Commercialization.

      (2) You agree to pay VGG a royalty equal to 10% of all Royalty Revenue
          (as defined in the next section), regardless of whether that revenue
          is received by you or any other person or entity. Royalty payments
          are calculated by multiplying the royalty rate of 10% by the Royalty
          Revenue. "Royalty Revenue" means all worldwide gross revenue
          attributable to each Royalty Product minus any allowed exclusions.

      (3) Worldwide gross revenue includes all revenue directly generated by
          your Royalty Product, regardless of who receives the revenue and
          regardless of whether you Commercialize your Royalty Product to end
          users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store,
          or work with a publisher or distributor. Royalty Revenue includes
          gross revenue:

          i. resulting from any and all sales of a Royalty Product to end
             users through any and all media, including but not limited to
             digital and retail;

          ii. resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable
              content, micro transactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or
              exchange of user-generated content for use with a Royalty
              Product, or redemption of virtual currency which directly
              affects the operation of the Royalty Product, whether redeemed
              within the Royalty Product or externally;

          iii. from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is
               directly associated with Royalty Product access or in-Royalty
               Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount
               is established in an early tier solely for Royalty Product
               access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for
               each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts
               in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

          iv. from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

          v. from any advance payments for a Royalty Product (from a publisher
             or otherwise);

          vi. received in connection with a Royalty Product's inclusion in a
              streaming, subscription, or other game-delivery service (e.g.,
              Apple Arcade, Microsoft GamePass, or any similar or successor
              services), including without limitation development funds and
              bonuses; and

          vii. received in any other form actually attributable to a Royalty
               Product (unless excluded below).

          However, some gross revenue is excluded from the calculation of
          Royalty Revenue Quarterly exclusion: You will not owe VGG any
          royalty payments for calendar quarters in which you don't reach a
          certain threshold. The following is excluded from the calculation of
          Royalty Revenue: the revenue attributable to a Royalty Product from
          a calendar quarter during which the gross revenue for such Royalty
          Product is less than $1000.

          Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which you
          earn Royalty Revenue, you must report the Royalty Revenue to VGG on
          a per Product basis and pay VGG 10% of the Royalty Revenue.

          VGG reserves the right to charge a 3% late fee, per calendar quarter
          (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date.

          Except to the extent required by applicable law, all payments, fees
          and royalties are non-refundable under all circumstances.

          You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be
          made by you under this License. If you are required by a government
          agency to reduce your payment to VGG for any reason, you are
          required to provide sufficient documentation to VGG supporting the
          withholding. VGG cannot answer your questions about withholding
          taxes or taxes in general.

   10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim by you arising out
       of or related to this License will be governed by English law. Any
       dispute, controversy or claim, arising out of or in connection with
       this License, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall
       be finally settled by the courts of England. The English language shall
       be used in the arbitral proceedings.
